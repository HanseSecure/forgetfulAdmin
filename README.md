Default Credentials in a structured form

This project is maintained by [Florian Hansemann](https://hansesecure.de/)

## Why
There are numerous lists of default credentials. But I have not found a updated list that also has information such as manufacturer, version number and the login URL/forms.
This list is intended to help others to create automated tools for the detection of standard access data.

## Help
This list is only as up-to-date and good as the work done by the community, so you are welcome to contribute ;-)
